# vv-chain-services

Blockchain integration and event processing services for the VeritasVault.ai platform.

## üîç Overview

This repository contains the event-driven microservices responsible for ingesting, processing, analyzing, and archiving blockchain event data from Tezos and EVM networks. It is part of the VeritasVault.ai platform and is tightly integrated with Goldsky, Azure Event Grid, and a distributed risk intelligence engine powered by Python-based ML.

The solution is designed with resilience, observability, and modularity in mind ‚Äî allowing independent teams to scale risk models, extend observability, or hook in new event sources with minimal friction.

## üéì Use Case Handlers

**Risk Function App:**
- Triggers on new asset price updates
- Recalculates portfolio LTV and TVL
- Publishes to Redis for dashboard
- Communicates with ML Engine for risk analysis

**Metrics Function App:**
- Extracts event type and timing
- Publishes metrics via OpenTelemetry
- Monitors system health and performance

**Alert Function App:**
- If LTV > threshold or abnormal TXs
- Sends to Teams / Email / SMS (via Logic App)
- Handles notification throttling and aggregation

**Archival Function App:**
- Batches and stores full JSON payloads
- Writes to Cosmos DB with TTL
- Manages data partitioning and indexing

## üöÄ Deployment

### Azure Functions

```bash
cd src/function-apps/RiskBotApp
func azure functionapp publish <function-app-name>
```

### ML Engine

The ML Engine can be deployed as a container to Azure Container Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service, or Azure App Service.

```bash
cd src/ml-engine
az acr build --registry <acr-name> --image ml-engine:latest .
```

## üß™ Testing

### .NET Tests

```bash
cd tests/RiskBotTests
dotnet test
```

### Python Tests

```bash
cd src/ml-engine
pytest
```

## üî® Goldsky Setup Notes

- Use `webhook` target type (POST)
- Payload format: JSON
- Use filtering logic in subgraph to minimize spam
- Include retry logic on failed webhook delivery (Goldsky handles retries)
- Include event signatures and timestamps for deduplication

## üåê Security & Observability

- All endpoints authenticated with Managed Identity
- Each Function App has its own Managed Identity with specific RBAC permissions
- OpenTelemetry integration for unified observability
- Event Grid Dead Letter Queue for failed delivery tracking
- Alerts routed to Security Center if abnormal spike in payloads
- Key Vault integration for secure secret management

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Benefits of This Architecture

#### **Decoupled Processing:**
Each Function App operates independently, allowing for flexible scaling and deployment

#### **High Resilience:**
Event Grid provides reliable delivery with retries and dead letter queues

#### **Scalable:**
Can handle increasing volumes of blockchain events as the platform grows

#### **Observable:**
Comprehensive logging and monitoring throughout the pipeline

#### **Secure:**
Managed Identities and Key Vault integration for secure secret management

#### **DevOps-Friendly:**
Infrastructure as Code (Bicep) for repeatable deployments

#### **Independent Scaling:**
Each Function App can scale based on its specific workload and requirements
