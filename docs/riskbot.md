## Core Components

### Risk Engine

The Risk Engine is the central component that processes and analyzes risk factors:

- **Risk Factor Aggregation**: Combines multiple risk signals
- **Risk Score Calculation**: Computes normalized risk scores
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Tracks when risks exceed defined thresholds
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies developing risk patterns
- **Correlation Detection**: Finds relationships between risk factors

### Rule Engine

The Rule Engine applies predefined rules to risk data:

- **Rule Definition**: Declarative rule specification
- **Rule Evaluation**: Applies rules to current risk state
- **Action Triggering**: Initiates actions based on rule matches
- **Rule Prioritization**: Handles conflicts between rules
- **Rule Versioning**: Manages rule lifecycle

### ML Models

The system uses several machine learning models:

- **Price Volatility Prediction**: Forecasts asset price movements
- **Liquidation Risk Assessment**: Predicts potential liquidation events
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in user or market behavior
- **Risk Clustering**: Groups similar risk profiles
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes market sentiment from external sources

### Action Orchestrator

The Action Orchestrator coordinates response actions:

- **Action Selection**: Chooses appropriate actions based on risk assessment
- **Action Prioritization**: Determines action execution order
- **Action Execution**: Triggers actions through appropriate channels
- **Action Monitoring**: Tracks action completion and effectiveness
- **Feedback Loop**: Updates risk assessment based on action outcomes

## Risk Assessment Model

### Risk Factors

The system monitors multiple risk categories:

| Risk Category | Risk Factors | Data Sources | Weight |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Market Risk | Price volatility, liquidity, correlation | Market data feeds, DEX activity | 30% |
| Credit Risk | Collateralization ratio, debt exposure | On-chain positions, lending protocols | 25% |
| Operational Risk | Smart contract vulnerabilities, governance attacks | Security scanners, governance proposals | 20% |
| Liquidity Risk | Withdrawal patterns, liquidity pool depth | On-chain activity, DEX metrics | 15% |
| Counterparty Risk | Protocol solvency, bridge security | Protocol metrics, security audits | 10% |

### Risk Score Calculation

Risk scores are calculated using a multi-factor model:

1. **Individual Factor Scoring**:
   - Each factor is normalized to a 0-100 scale
   - Factors are adjusted for recent volatility
   - Outliers are handled with statistical methods

2. **Weighted Aggregation**:
   - Factors are weighted by importance
   - Category scores are calculated
   - Overall risk score is computed

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Weights adapt based on market conditions
   - Historical correlation influences weights
   - Expert input from Plurality adjusts weights

### Risk Thresholds

The system defines multiple risk thresholds:

| Risk Level | Score Range | Alert Level | Action Level |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Low | 0-25 | Informational | None |
| Moderate | 26-50 | Low | Monitoring |
| Elevated | 51-75 | Medium | Preventive |
| High | 76-90 | High | Protective |
| Critical | 91-100 | Critical | Emergency |

## Automated Actions

### Alert Generation

The system generates tiered alerts:

| Alert Level | Delivery Method | Frequency | Content |
|------------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Informational | Weekly digest | Weekly | Risk summary, educational content |
| Low | Daily digest | Daily | Risk factors, recommended actions |
| Medium | Direct notification | Real-time | Specific risks, action recommendations |
| High | Priority notification | Real-time | Urgent risks, required actions |
| Critical | Multi-channel alert | Real-time | Emergency information, automatic actions |

### Mitigation Actions

The system can initiate various mitigation actions:

1. **Monitoring Actions**:
   - Increase monitoring frequency
   - Enable additional data sources
   - Trigger manual review

2. **Preventive Actions**:
   - Suggest portfolio rebalancing
