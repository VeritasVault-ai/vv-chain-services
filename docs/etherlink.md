## Troubleshooting (continued)

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Attestation timeout | Operator unavailability | Configure longer timeouts or fallback operators |
| Low attestation count | Insufficient operator selection | Increase operator diversity and count |
| Reward distribution failure | Contract interaction issues | Check gas settings and contract permissions |
| Slashing events | Operator misbehavior | Implement operator blacklisting and stake reallocation |
| AVS integration errors | Incompatible parameters | Verify AVS configuration and update parameters |
| Yield below expectations | Suboptimal allocation | Review and adjust yield optimization algorithm |
| Security score discrepancies | Weight misconfiguration | Recalibrate security layer weights |

## Deployment Strategy

### Phased Rollout

The EigenLayer integration follows a phased deployment approach:

1. **Phase 1: Basic Integration**
   - Integrate with EigenLayer SDK
   - Implement basic attestation flow
   - Set up monitoring and analytics

2. **Phase 2: Restaking Implementation**
   - Deploy restaking contracts
   - Configure operator selection
   - Implement reward distribution

3. **Phase 3: AVS Integration**
   - Select and integrate with AVS providers
   - Implement AVS-specific validation flows
   - Configure AVS parameters

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Implement advanced yield strategies
   - Deploy sophisticated security scoring
   - Enable cross-layer security coordination

### Migration Considerations

When migrating existing systems to include EigenLayer:

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Maintain support for non-EigenLayer security flows
   - Implement feature flags for gradual adoption
   - Support dual-path operations during transition

2. **Data Migration**:
   - Map existing security metrics to EigenLayer model
   - Establish historical performance baselines
   - Preserve audit trails across migration

3. **User Experience**:
   - Communicate security enhancements to users
   - Provide opt-in mechanisms for early adopters
   - Maintain consistent UX during transition

## Governance Integration

### Security Parameter Governance

EigenLayer security parameters are managed through governance:

1. **Governable Parameters**:
   - Required attestation thresholds
   - Operator selection criteria
   - Security score weights
   - Slashing configuration

2. **Governance Process**:
   - Parameter change proposals
   - Expert review by security council
   - Community voting with expertise weighting
   - Timelock for implementation

3. **Emergency Procedures**:
   - Security council override for critical issues
   - Rapid response protocol for vulnerabilities
   - Rollback mechanisms for problematic changes

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Advanced Attestation Mechanisms**:
   - Zero-knowledge attestations for privacy
   - Cross-chain attestation aggregation
   - Reputation-weighted attestation scoring

2. **Enhanced Yield Strategies**:
   - Dynamic operator rotation based on performance
   - Automated yield strategy optimization
   - Custom AVS development for platform-specific needs

3. **Deeper Integration**:
   - Native EigenLayer integration in user interfaces
   - Real-time security scoring visualization
   - Predictive security modeling
