## Security Model Integration

### Triple-Layer Security Architecture

VeritasVault.ai implements a triple-layer security model that combines:

1. **Tezos Security Layer**: Leverages Tezos consensus and validation
2. **EVM Security Layer**: Utilizes EVM chain security mechanisms
3. **EigenLayer Security Layer**: Adds restaking security guarantees

This layered approach provides defense-in-depth, requiring an attacker to compromise multiple security mechanisms to affect the platform.

### Security Attestation Flow

For high-value operations, the platform implements a multi-layer attestation process:

1. **Operation Initiation**:
   - User initiates a sensitive operation (e.g., large withdrawal)
   - Risk Bot identifies the need for enhanced security

2. **Attestation Request**:
   - Security Manager requests attestations from multiple layers
   - EigenLayer SDK submits attestation request to EigenLayer

3. **Multi-Layer Validation**:
   - EigenLayer operators validate the operation
   - Tezos validators provide additional verification
   - EVM validators contribute to the security score

4. **Consensus Formation**:
   - Security Manager collects attestations from all layers
   - Weighted consensus determines security approval
   - Operation proceeds only with sufficient security score

## Restaking Integration

### Restaking Benefits

EigenLayer restaking provides several benefits to the VeritasVault.ai platform:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Additional security layer through economic incentives
2. **Yield Opportunities**: Generate additional yield on staked ETH
3. **Slashing Risks**: Disincentivize malicious behavior through slashing
4. **Security Scaling**: Scale security with the size of the ETH staking ecosystem

### Restaking Configuration

The platform integrates with EigenLayer's restaking mechanism through:

1. **Operator Selection**:
   - Define criteria for selecting EigenLayer operators
   - Balance between security, reputation, and cost
   - Implement operator rotation for risk distribution

2. **Stake Allocation**:
   - Determine optimal stake allocation across operators
   - Set minimum and maximum stake per operator
   - Implement dynamic allocation based on performance

3. **Reward Distribution**:
   - Configure reward distribution between platform and users
   - Set fee structure for restaking services
   - Implement transparent reward tracking

## AVS Integration

### AVS Selection Criteria

The platform selects Actively Validated Services based on:

1. **Security Requirements**: Match AVS security to platform needs
2. **Service Compatibility**: Ensure AVS supports required features
3. **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate AVS performance and reliability
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Balance security benefits with cost
5. **Ecosystem Integration**: Prefer AVS with broader ecosystem connections

### AVS Implementation

The platform implements AVS integration through:

1. **Service Registration**:
   - Register with selected AVS providers
   - Configure service parameters
   - Establish communication channels

2. **Validation Request Flow**:
   - Define validation request format
   - Implement request routing logic
   - Configure response handling

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Track AVS response times
   - Monitor validation accuracy
   - Implement fallback mechanisms

## Yield Optimization

### Restaking Yield Strategies

The platform implements several yield strategies with EigenLayer:

1. **Basic Restaking**:
   - Restake ETH with EigenLayer operators
   - Earn base restaking rewards
   - Minimal risk profile

2. **Multi-AVS Participation**:
   - Participate in multiple AVS ecosystems
   - Stack rewards across services
   - Balanced risk-reward profile

3. **Operator Node Running**:
   - Run EigenLayer operator nodes
   - Earn operator rewards
   - Higher technical requirements

### Yield Optimization Algorithm

The platform's yield optimizer considers:

1. **Risk Parameters**:
   - Slashing risk assessment
   - Operator reputation scores
   - Historical performance data

2. **Reward Factors**:
   - Base restaking APR
   - AVS-specific rewards
   - Fee structures

3. **Platform Constraints**:
   - Liquidity requirements
   - Security thresholds
   - Diversification targets

## Implementation Guide

### Integration Components

The EigenLayer integration consists of several key components:

1. **EigenLayer SDK**:
   - Core interface to EigenLayer protocols
   - Handles contract interactions

- **Attestation Time**: Average time to complete attestations
- **Operator Performance**: Performance metrics for selected operators
- **Restaking Yield**: Actual vs. expected yield from restaking
- **Security Score Distribution**: Distribution of security scores across operations

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

## Troubleshooting (continued)
