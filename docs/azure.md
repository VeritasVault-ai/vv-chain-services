## Deployment Architecture

The platform uses a multi-environment deployment architecture:

### Environment Structure

| Environment | Purpose | Scaling | Data Retention |
|------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Development | Feature development | Minimal | 7 days |
| Testing | Integration testing | Moderate | 14 days |
| Staging | Pre-production validation | Production-like | 30 days |
| Production | Live system | Full scale | Indefinite |

### Resource Groups

Resources are organized into logical groups:

- **vv-core-{env}**: Core platform services
- **vv-data-{env}**: Data storage services
- **vv-integration-{env}**: Integration services
- **vv-blockchain-{env}**: Blockchain connectors
- **vv-monitoring-{env}**: Monitoring services
- **vv-security-{env}**: Security services

### Deployment Patterns

The platform uses several deployment patterns:

1. **Blue-Green Deployment**:
   - Maintain two identical environments
   - Deploy to inactive environment
   - Switch traffic when validated
   - Minimize downtime

2. **Feature Flags**:
   - Deploy features behind flags
   - Enable gradually for users
   - Roll back easily if issues arise
   - A/B test new features

3. **Canary Releases**:
   - Release to small percentage of users
   - Monitor for issues
   - Gradually increase percentage
   - Automated rollback on errors

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

- **App Service Plans**: Auto-scale based on CPU and memory
- **Function Apps**: Consumption plan for event-driven scaling
- **Container Apps**: Scale based on HTTP traffic and event load
- **Cosmos DB**: Scale throughput based on RU consumption

### Vertical Scaling

- **SQL Database**: Scale up during peak periods
- **Redis Cache**: Increase cache size for high-volume periods
- **App Service**: Scale up for memory-intensive operations

### Regional Scaling

- **Primary Region**: East US 2
- **Secondary Region**: West US 2
- **Global Distribution**: Azure Front Door for global routing
- **Data Replication**: Geo-redundant storage and databases

## Security Architecture

### Network Security

- **Virtual Networks**: Isolated network environments
- **Network Security Groups**: Fine-grained access control
- **Private Endpoints**: Private connectivity to Azure services
- **Service Endpoints**: Secure access to Azure services

### Identity and Access

- **Azure Active Directory**: Identity management
- **Managed Identities**: Service-to-service authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions
- **Conditional Access**: Context-based access policies

### Data Protection

- **Azure Blueprints**: Compliant environment templates
- **Regulatory Compliance**: SOC, ISO, GDPR, etc.
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous security assessment

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

| Service | Backup Frequency | Retention | Recovery Method |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| SQL Database | Hourly | 35 days | Point-in-time restore |
| Cosmos DB | Continuous | 30 days | Point-in-time restore |
| App Service | Daily | 30 days | App backup restore |
| Storage | GRS replication | N/A | Geo-failover |
| Key Vault | Soft delete | 90 days | Recover deleted secrets |

### Recovery Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 15 minutes
- **Service Level Objective (SLO)**: 99.9% availability

### Failover Strategy

1. **Database Failover**:
   - Automatic failover for SQL Database
   - Manual failover for Cosmos DB
   - Read replicas for continued read access

2. **Application Failover**:
   - Traffic Manager for regional failover
   - Front Door for global routing
   - Health probes for automatic detection

3. **Storage Failover**:
   - RA-GRS for read access during outages

## Cost Optimization

### Cost Management Strategies

1. **Right-sizing Resources**:
   - Match resource size to workload
   - Scale down during off-peak hours
   - Use consumption-based services where appropriate

2. **Reserved Instances**:
   - 1-year commitments for predictable workloads
   - 3-year commitments for core infrastructure
   - Hybrid benefit for Windows workloads

3. **Dev/Test Subscriptions**:
   - Use dev/test pricing for non-production
   - Shut down resources outside working hours
   - Implement auto-shutdown for VMs

### Monitoring and Optimization
